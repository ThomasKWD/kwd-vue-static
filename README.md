# KWD website

Website demo powered by [VueJS](https://vuejs.org), [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js), Github, and [Redaxo](https://redaxo.org).

Some content under [_posts](./posts) is generated by NetlifyCMS although it has become less interesting. NetlifyCMS in my opinion is not mature enough and slow when it comes to edit-and-watch-the-result because of the checkin-push-generate life cycle.

More important is including content edited by Redaxo and supplied via an [Redaxo json API addon](https://github.com/ThomasKWD/api_json) to the nuxt app.
